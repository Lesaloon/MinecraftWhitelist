This bot was made after a night where 10 people asked me to whitelist them.
I was not patient. And so I decided to automate it.

To do that I made a discord bot that would allow people to give their username and get whitelisted on the server.
of course there is a security aspect :
1. you need to be on the server
2. one discord account is one Minecraft name ( so you can register your Alt account )


> also don’t worry about the IP it is a very old server hosted on mtx so it’s not mine anymore
